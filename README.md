# PlayPause

I started to create this application because when Visual Studio is open, as an administrator, the play/pause buttons on my keyboard don't work with iTunes.

My original fix was to run iTunes as an Administrator, but that lead to the buttons not working when I was in email, etc.

So I decided to write a program to detect keystrokes and send them if needed.

But then I realized this wasn't an issue in Spotify and I'm probably not going to keep Apple Music after the 3 months.

If I keep Apple Music, I might come back to this, but until then: Spotify Premium FTW!
